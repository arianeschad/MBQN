## GitHub Documents

This packages contains a modified quantile normalization function for omics data or other matrix like data. The normalization removes systematics batch effects between measurements. The modification is obtained by a mean correction step. This reduces systematics in downstream analysis of features that are always of largest intensity accross all samples. This function uses normalize.quantiles() from the package preprocessCore that can be installed from http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R

### Installing The Package

To install this package from Github, you will need to Hadley Wickham's devtools package installed.

install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")

To install MBQN run the following line:

devtools::install_github("arianeschad/mbqn")

Additional packages needed to run MBQN and examples: 
install.packages( pkgs = c("preprocessCore","limma","rpx"), dependencies = TRUE)

After installation, check out the `?MBQN` help file to see a full working example with further documentation.

## Basic Useage

The package provides the basic function `mbqn()` which does the normalization. To run this function, you will need to provide a matrix as input similar to data matrix in `example1`.

## Example

This example code will download data from the PRIDE repository, normalize the data, identifies RI/NRI features and give graphical output.
