\title{Mean-balanced quantile normalization}
\usage{
mbqn(x, FUN = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data matrix. Rows represent features, e.g. protein abundances; columns replicates, samples.}

\item{FUN}{mean, median, or a user defined function, or an array with dim = numbers of rows of dat. If left empty, quantile normalization is applied without balancing the data.}
}
\value{
A matrix of mean- or median-balanced quantile normalized data.
}
\description{
Quantile-normalize omics data matrix. Suppress systematic flattening of feature variation across columns for features over-represented in the tails of the intensity distribution across columns. This is done by balance each row of the data matrix by its mean before and redo balancing after normalization.
}
\details{
Function to compute a mean-balanced quantile normalization.
